      <h1>Automation Sovereignty – Concept Note</h1>
      <img class="logo" src="/logo-automationsovereignty.png" alt="AutomationSovereignty.com logo">
      <p class="muted">
        This Concept Note introduces the idea of <strong>“Automation Sovereignty”</strong> as a
        <strong>board-level framing</strong> for organisations that increasingly rely on software automation,
        AI agents and orchestrated workflows in critical activities. It is provided as an independent,
        descriptive reference only. It does not promote any product, service or programme.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The term <strong>Automation Sovereignty</strong> can be used to describe the ability of a legitimate
        organisation, or a public authority, to <strong>retain meaningful control over its automated
        systems, agents and workflows</strong> in line with its own laws, mandates and values – rather than
        becoming structurally dependent on opaque, external automation stacks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        In this note, <strong>Automation Sovereignty</strong> refers to the capacity of a board, an executive
        team or a public authority to ensure that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>critical <strong>automated decisions, workflows and agents</strong> remain understandable, governable and reversible;</li>
        <li>automation pipelines are <strong>aligned with applicable law and regulation</strong>, including sectoral rules and fundamental rights;</li>
        <li>dependencies on external providers of AI, cloud, data and automation tooling do not undermine <strong>strategic freedom of action</strong>;</li>
        <li>responsibilities for automated behaviour are clearly allocated, audited and overseen at board level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this framing, “sovereignty” is not about isolation. It is about maintaining <strong>meaningful control
        over automated capabilities</strong> that increasingly shape risk, resilience and competitiveness.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Context and drivers</h2>
      <p>
        Boards are entering a period where automation is no longer limited to static workflows. AI agents,
        orchestration platforms and autonomous decision-making tools are being deployed across finance, energy,
        healthcare, mobility and public services. In parallel, jurisdictions such as the European Union are
        strengthening the regulatory environment around AI, data and digital infrastructure (for example the
        <strong>AI Act</strong>, the <strong>Data Act</strong>, the <strong>Cyber Resilience Act</strong> and
        <strong>NIS2</strong>, together with sectoral frameworks supervised by financial and prudential
        authorities). These initiatives emphasise transparency, accountability, security and risk management for
        digital systems, including those that are highly automated.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, debates on <strong>digital and AI sovereignty</strong> highlight the need for regions
        and organisations to avoid excessive structural dependence on a small number of foreign technology
        providers, especially for cloud, data and strategic AI models. Questions of localisation, jurisdiction,
        contractual control and operational resilience are now routinely raised in supervisory dialogues and
        board discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent discussions on <strong>agentic automation</strong> describe software agents that can act across
        systems, jurisdictions and data silos. As these capabilities mature, sovereignty is likely to become a
        design primitive: organisations may wish to define where agents are allowed to act, which assets they
        can touch, how they are monitored and how their behaviour can be constrained or revoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Against this backdrop, the notion of <strong>Automation Sovereignty</strong> can help boards describe,
        at a high level, the degree of control they wish to retain over:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>where automated systems are hosted and operated;</li>
        <li>how data used by those systems is governed, protected and, where necessary, localised;</li>
        <li>which functions remain under direct human supervision and which may be delegated to agents;</li>
        <li>how obligations under emerging digital, cybersecurity and AI regulation are met when automation is deeply embedded in operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Possible uses of this framing</h2>
      <p>
        The term <strong>Automation Sovereignty</strong> does not describe a standard or certification.
        It is a possible <strong>board-level framing</strong> that may help organisations structure
        discussions such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>mapping where the most critical automated workflows sit (payments, trading, safety systems, industrial control, clinical workflows, mobility, etc.);</li>
        <li>identifying <strong>concentrated dependencies</strong> on particular providers of AI, automation or cloud infrastructure;</li>
        <li>defining which parts of the automation stack should remain <strong>under direct organisational control</strong> (governance, keys, data, models, decision rights);</li>
        <li>designing <strong>fallback and manual override</strong> options in case automated systems fail, are compromised or must be switched off;</li>
        <li>aligning automation choices with obligations under AI, cybersecurity, safety, prudential or sectoral regulation;</li>
        <li>developing high-level <strong>dashboards, scenarios or stress tests</strong> that take into account automation failures, data exfiltration or vendor lock-in.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In practice, the concept could be used as a rubric in board materials, risk reports or strategy
        documents to make automation-related dependencies and choices more explicit. It may also help
        structure dialogue between boards, regulators, auditors and technology providers.

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        This Concept Note does <strong>not</strong> introduce a legal notion, a formal standard, a label
        or a certification scheme. It does not modify any existing obligation arising from law, regulation,
        supervisory guidance or contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term <strong>Automation Sovereignty</strong> is used here purely as an <strong>informal framing</strong>.
        It may overlap, in part, with other expressions used by policymakers, supervisors, standard-setters or
        industry bodies. Where there is any discrepancy, the <strong>official texts and positions</strong> of
        competent authorities always prevail.
      </p>
      <p>
        This note does not recommend any specific governance model, technical architecture, provider, product
        or deployment choice. It is not intended to be relied upon as evidence of compliance.
